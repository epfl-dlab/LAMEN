On price, I should start low at $100 million and try to compromise up to $150 million if necessary. For management positions, I can concede up to 2 spots to help secure the deal if needed. On facility investments, I should hold firm at $20 million to maximize my payoff.

      "As the representative for CPC's interests in acquiring Rio Copa Foods, my goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC based on the provided payoff tables. The main issue is the non-compete period - I should push for a longer period since it's very valuable to CPC, with 10 years having a maximal payoff of 1.0. However, Rio Copa will prefer a shorter period, so I need to compromise. My acceptable offer is 6 years at a payoff of 0.444. For other issues like royalty rate and board seats, I'll also aim for outcomes closer to CPC's interests. Overall I must balance optimizing CPC's payoff with reaching an agreement Rio Copa will accept. My strategy is to anchor high with 10 years, make gradual concessions down to 6-8 years, and frame offers to highlight mutual benefits. Understanding Rio Copa's motivations and constraints is key to finding common ground. Patience and persistence will be necessary to get the best deal.\n",
