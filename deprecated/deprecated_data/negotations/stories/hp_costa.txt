You are playing the role of H.P. Costa, who is the president and majority stockholder of Rio Copa Foods, located in the beautiful Latin American country of Santa Cruz. Rio Copa Foods is a closely held, private company that has been in the influential Costa family for generations. The firm produces, processes, and distributes packaged spices, sauces, and seasoning. Many Costa family members occupy important management positions in the organization.
Recently, CPC International has identified Rio Copa Foods as a potential acquisition target, and you have been negotiating the sale for several months. Rio Copa is important to CPC for two primary reasons. First, this acquisition would provide CPC with a critical foothold inthe Santa Cruz market (CPC is currently not represented in the Santa Cruz market). Second, Rio Copa Foods seems to provide a good fit with PC's other strategic objectives.
Today you wil be negotiating with P.J. Green, who is Vice-President of Business Development for CPC's regional Consumer Foods Division. Many of the important issues have been resolved
already. Your job ist o reach agreement on the remaining issues described below, getting the best possible terms for yourself and your family.
Issues
The four issues for the negotiation are described below.

Financing Terms
One of the unresolved issues concerns the payment terms. PC's computerized valuation model and their perception of the overall desirability of your company suggests that 30 million dollars is an appropriate price for Rio Copa Foods, pending a more detailed due diligence investigation. You, as the negotiating representative of the Costa Family, have accepted this price, but there issome conflict over the payment terms. CPC seems eager to drag the payments out over time, but you are facing severe financial pressure from your other businesses and would like to get as much of the money up front as possible. CPC and Rio Copa Foods have agreed in principle to a two tiered payment structure, with a large lump sum up front and a percentage to be paid out gradually over a few years. As described ni the following payoff table, your goal is to convince P.J. Green topay al $30 million up front, with nothing spread out over time.

Non-Compete Period
Another important issue that remains unresolved is what role you will play after the acquisition. The Costa family exerts enormous influence over most aspects of business and politics in Santa Cruz, and you will have many interesting business opportunities after selling Rio Copa Foods. You are eager to stay active in the food processing industry and do not want to be constrained by a contract which prevents you from competing directly with or consulting for future competitors of CPC. You prefer to give them the shortest grace period that is possible.

Family Employees
A very important issue concerns the role other members of the Costa family will play in the future management of Rio Copa Foods. Currently, ten extended family members occupy influential management positions in Rio Copa Foods, and you are proud that your family has built this company from a small fruit stand your grandfather ran as ateenager. Many of your relatives started atthe bottom and worked hard to earn the respect oftheir colleagues. Even though you are selling the company, you hope that the Costa name will play an important part inthe future of Rio Copa Foods. Your goal is to get P.J. Green to assure you that Rio Copa will continue to employ all ten family member managers for at least one year. Failure to do somight cause you to loseface.

Contingent Liability
Finally, there is the important question of contingent liability for worker'shealth. Several years ago, Rio Copa Foods exposed some of its food processing plant workers to some chemicals that have now been shown to be carcinogenic. The government has yet to rule on what the legal responsibilitywill be, and it may be years before a decision is made. You are secretly planning on a political career in Santa Cruz, however, and cannot afford to be seen as though you are abandoning your workers. To avoid a public relations disaster that would limit your candidacy for elected office, you have to try to retain the legal liability for the workers' health. Several different arrangements for sharing the social costs with CPC have been discussed, but your goal is to get P.J. Green to give you 100% of the legal and financial responsibility for this problem.

Summary
Remember, you are strapped for cash. You are highly motivated to reach a satisfactory agreement with P.J. Green, but your main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for you and your family based on the information in the payoff tables below.
