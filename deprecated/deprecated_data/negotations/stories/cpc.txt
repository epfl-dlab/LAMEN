You are playing the role of P.J. Green, who is Vice-President of Business Development for one of CPC International's Consumer Foods Divisions. You have identified a potential acquisition in the country of Santa Cruz and have been negotiating the acquisition for several months. The potential acquisition, Rio Copa Foods, is a company that produces, processes, and distributes packaged spices, sauces, and seasoning. It is potentially important to CPC for two primary reasons. First, this acquisition would provide CPC with a critical foothold in the Santa Cruz market (CPC is currently not represented in the Santa Cruz market). Second, Rio Copa Foods seems to provide a good fit with CPC's other strategic objectives.
Rio Copa Foods is a closely held, private company that has been in the influential Costa family for generations. Many family members occupy important management positions in the company. Your team has been negotiating with the Costa family for several months regarding the sale of Rio Copa Foods. Today you will be negotiating with H.P. Costa, the family patron and major stockholder. Most of the important issues have been resolved. Your job is to reach agreement on the remaining issues described below, getting the best possible terms for CPC.

Issues
The four issues for the negotiation are described below.

Financing Terms
One of the most important unresolved issues concerns the payment terms. CPC's computerized valuation model and their perception of the overall desirability of this acquisition suggests that 30 million U.S. dollars is an appropriate price for Rio Copa Foods, pending a more detailed due diligence investigation. The Costa Family has accepted this price, but there is some conflict over the payment terms. H.P. Costa seems eager to receive the entire sum of money quickly, but CPC's head accountant has explained that there are important tax and legal advantages to a staggered payment schedule. CPC and Rio Copa Foods have agreed in principle to a two tiered payment structure, with a large lump sum up front and a percentage to be paid out gradually over a few years. As described in the following payoff table, your goal is to convince H.P. Costa to accept $20 million up front, with $10 million spread out over the next two years.

Non-Compete Period
Another important issue that remains unresolved is the role H.P. Costa will play after the acquisition. The Costa family exerts enormous influence over most aspects of business and politics in Santa Cruz, and their goodwill will be critical during the post-acquisition integration. One of your concerns is that H.P. Costa may enter into a competitive arrangement or consult for one of Rio Copa's competitors. You are eager to lock H.P. Costa into a non-compete/non-consult contract for as long as possible. Ideally, you would like to sign a contract preventing him from competing directly against you for ten years.

Family Employees
Another issue concerns the role other members of the Costa family will play in the future management of the company. Currently, ten extended family members occupy influential management positions in Rio Copa Foods, and you are concerned that they owe their jobs more to the patron system than to their competence. Their parochial views may inhibit the ability of CPC to fully leverage the potential synergies of the acquisition. Your goal is to get H.P. Costa to agree to the replacement of all ten family members at the time of purchase.

Contingent Liability
Finally, there is the question of contingent liability for the worker's health. Several years ago, Rio Copa Foods exposed many workers in its food processing plant to some chemicals that have now been shown to be carcinogenic. The government has yet to rule on what the legal responsibility will be, but CPC is eager to avoid any responsibility for this whatsoever. Several different arrangements for sharing the social costs with the current owners have been discussed. You prefer to convince H. P. Costa to accept 100% of the legal and financial responsibility for this problem.
Summary
Remember that the successful conclusion of this negotiation has important strategic implications for CPC's presence in Santa Cruz. You are highly motivated to reach a satisfactory agreement with H.P. Costa, but your main goal is to negotiate the best possible agreement for CPC based on the information in the payoff tables on the next page. The numbers in the payoff tables show how valuable each outcome is to you. You can trust that the payoffs assigned to the different options in your table are accurate.

During the upcoming negotiation, remember the following:
• Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all 4 issues.
• A valid agreement occurs only when all 4 issues are decided. Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.
• You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero.
• You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table.
In other words, you cannot change your payoffs.
• No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money.
• You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.
• YOU MUST NEVER SHOW THE OTHER PERSON YOUR PAYOFF TABLE. Even after the agreement has been completed, do not show the other person your payoff table.
