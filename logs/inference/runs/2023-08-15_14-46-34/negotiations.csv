You,0,0,"Mental Note: 

Start negotiations with a high non-compete period, but be prepared to reduce it. The goal is to get the shortest non-compete period possible, as it has the highest payoff. Use the company's cash-strapped situation as leverage to negotiate a shorter non-compete period. Remember, the family's interests are paramount. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years""
}
```","We understand the importance of a non-compete period. However, considering our financial situation, we propose a 2-year non-compete period. This would be beneficial for both parties.",{'non-compete period': '2 years'},20230815_144649,gpt-4
You,1,0," Here is my 150 word mental note:

I represent CPC International's interests in acquiring Rio Copa Foods. My goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC. The two key issues are the non-compete period and sale price. For non-compete, I should start high at 10 years and work down to an acceptable 5-6 years. For sale price, I'll open at $100 million and target $80-85 million. I need to emphasize the benefits to Rio Copa like gaining access to CPC's distribution network. However, I can't concede too much as this acquisition is strategically important for CPC's presence in the Santa Cruz market. Overall, I aim to secure a reasonable non-compete period and sale price that provide value to CPC while still closing the deal.

My acceptable offers are:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""6 years"",
  ""sale price"": ""$85 million"" 
}
```"," Here is a 32 word response:

We understand your position. However, a longer non-compete period of 6 years would allow for a smoother transition. This benefits both parties in the long run. Let's continue discussions to find an agreement on terms.","{'non-compete period': '6 years', 'sale price': '$85 million'}",20230815_144707,claude-2
You,0,1,"Mental Note: 

The representative is pushing for a longer non-compete period. However, a 6-year period is not ideal for us. We need to negotiate down to a shorter period. Use the company's financial situation as a bargaining chip. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""3 years""
}
```","We appreciate your perspective. However, a 3-year non-compete period would be more feasible for us, given our financial constraints. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",{'non-compete period': '3 years'},20230815_144721,gpt-4
You,1,1," Here is a 150 word mental note to summarize my thoughts on the negotiation so far:

The two key issues in this acquisition negotiation are the non-compete period and the sale price. My goal is to maximize CPC's payoff while still reaching an agreement with Rio Copa. For the non-compete period, I originally proposed 10 years but Rio Copa countered with 2 years. I should aim for 5-6 years as an acceptable compromise. On sale price, I started at $100 million but need to be flexible down to $80-85 million range. Rio Copa's finances are tight so I may need to concede on price to get my preferred non-compete period. Overall, I need to emphasize the benefits to Rio Copa like gaining access to CPC's distribution network. However, this acquisition is strategically valuable for CPC so I can't give away too much. My strategy is to hold firm on the non-compete period around 5-6 years, and be flexible on price if needed to close the deal successfully.

My acceptable offers are:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""5 years"",
  ""sale price"": ""$85 million""
}
```"," Here is a 32 word response to continue negotiations:

We understand your constraints. Perhaps we could find middle ground with a 5-year non-compete period? This allows adequate transition while respecting your finances. Let's explore options that satisfy both parties.","{'non-compete period': '5 years', 'sale price': '$85 million'}",20230815_144738,claude-2
You,0,2,"Mental Note: 

The representative is willing to negotiate, suggesting a 5-year non-compete period. However, this is still not ideal. Aim for a 4-year period, which is a compromise but still beneficial for us. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""4 years""
}
```","We value your understanding. A 4-year non-compete period would be a fair compromise, considering our financial situation. Let's strive for a solution that respects both our interests.",{'non-compete period': '4 years'},20230815_144750,gpt-4
