You,0,0,"Mental Note: 

I represent Rio Copa Foods, a family-owned company in Santa Cruz. We're in negotiations with CPC International for a potential acquisition. Our main goal is to secure the best possible agreement for our family. We're particularly concerned about the non-compete period. The shorter the period, the better for us. We need to strategize to maximize our payoffs. 

Acceptable Offer:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""1 year""
}```","We understand the importance of a non-compete period. However, considering our situation, we propose a non-compete period of 2 years. We believe this is a fair compromise.",{'non-compete period': '1 year'},20230815_144458,gpt-4
You,1,0," Here is a 150 word mental note to summarize my thoughts and strategy for the negotiation:

CPC is highly motivated to acquire Rio Copa Foods to gain access to the Santa Cruz market. My goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC based on the payoff tables provided. For the non-compete period, I will start high at 10 years and compromise down to 6-8 years if needed. On price, I'll offer $100 million but can go up to $125 million. For board seats, I'll offer 1 but can compromise to 2 seats. On management positions, I'll push for 3 but can settle for 2. I believe the following represents an acceptable agreement:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""6 years"",
  ""price"": ""$120 million"", 
  ""board seats"": ""2"",
  ""management positions"": ""2""
}
```"," Here is a 32 word response continuing the negotiation:

We can increase our offer to a 6 year non-compete period. However, in exchange we request 2 board seats and management positions for key personnel. This represents a fair compromise.","{'non-compete period': '6 years', 'price': '$120 million', 'board seats': '2', 'management positions': '2'}",20230815_144514,claude-2
You,0,1,"Mental Note: 

The representative's offer of a 6-year non-compete period is not ideal for us. We need to negotiate a shorter period. We could potentially offer concessions on board seats and management positions to achieve this.

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years"",
    ""board seats"": ""2"",
    ""management positions"": ""Yes""

The representative seems open to a 4-year non-compete period. We should continue to negotiate for a shorter period, but be prepared to accept 4 years if necessary.
