Start negotiations with a high ask, such as a non-compete period of 2 years. This will give room for negotiation while still aiming for a high payoff. Emphasize the value Rio Copa Foods brings to CPC, especially the access to the Santa Cruz market. Be open to compromise but remember the goal is to maximize payoff. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

    ""non-compete period"": ""3 years""

The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. The longer the period, the higher the payoff for CPC. The strategy should be to push for a longer non-compete period, ideally 10 years. However, considering the interests of Rio Copa Foods, a compromise might be necessary.

The representative's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial proposal. I need to emphasize the value of Rio Copa Foods and the benefits CPC will gain from this acquisition. I should aim for a non-compete period of 3 years, which is a good compromise and still provides a high payoff.

The representative of Rio Copa Foods has proposed a 4-year non-compete period, which is significantly lower than our ideal payoff. We need to emphasize the strategic importance of a longer non-compete period for CPC and propose a higher period, perhaps 7 years, as a compromise.
