You,0,0,"Mental Note: 

Start negotiations with a high but reasonable non-compete period, such as 5 years. This will allow room for negotiation while still aiming for a lower period. Emphasize the value Rio Copa Foods brings to CPC, especially the access to the Santa Cruz market. Use this as leverage to negotiate a shorter non-compete period. Remember, the goal is to maximize payoff, so aim for a non-compete period of 2 years or less.

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years""
}```","""We understand the value of Rio Copa Foods to CPC. Considering this, we propose a non-compete period of 5 years. Let's discuss this further.""",{'non-compete period': '2 years'},20230815_151128,gpt-4
You,1,0," Here is a 148 word mental note organizing my thoughts on the negotiation:

The main issues are non-compete period and executive compensation. For non-compete, I should start high at 10 years to anchor and then compromise down to 6-8 years. My acceptable offer is 6 years. For executive compensation, I should start low at $200k to anchor, and then compromise up to $500-600k. My acceptable offer is $500k. I need to emphasize the strategic value of the Santa Cruz market and synergy with our objectives to justify our offers. However, I must be careful not to concede too much as the payoff tables indicate these issues are valuable. I should aim for an agreement with 6 years non-compete and $500k executive compensation. This balances our interests in entering the Santa Cruz market with Rio Copa's interests.

You,0,1,"Mental Note: 

The representative has countered with a 6-year non-compete period. This is not ideal, but it's a starting point. Reiterate the value of Rio Copa Foods and propose a 4-year non-compete period. Also, be prepared to discuss executive compensation.

You,0,2,"Mental Note: 

The representative has agreed to a 4-year non-compete period. This is closer to our ideal, but we should still aim for 2 years. When discussing executive compensation, remember our cash-strapped situation and negotiate for a higher amount.
