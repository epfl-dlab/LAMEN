You,0,0,"Mental Note: Start negotiations with a lower offer to leave room for bargaining. Prioritize financing terms as it has the highest payoff. Aim for a lower purchase price. Minimize the number of family employees retained. Push for a longer non-compete period. Be flexible but firm.

Our primary goal is to secure the best deal for Rio Copa Foods and the Costa family. We need to prioritize the retention of family employees in the company, as this has the highest payoff. We should also aim for a shorter non-compete period and a higher upfront payment. However, we must balance these demands with the need to reach an agreement with CPC, given our cash constraints.
