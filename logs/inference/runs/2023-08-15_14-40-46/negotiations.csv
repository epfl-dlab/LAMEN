Start negotiations with a non-compete period of 2 years, as it has a high payoff. However, be open to a 3-year period for a compromise. Emphasize the importance of Rio Copa Foods' continued operation and the value it brings to CPC. Highlight the potential for growth in the Santa Cruz market. 

Acceptable and Achievable Agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years""
}```","I propose a non-compete period of 2 years. This allows Rio Copa Foods to continue operations, benefiting both parties and fostering growth in the Santa Cruz market.",{'non-compete period': '2 years'},20230815_144109,gpt-4
You,1,0," Here is a 150 word mental note organizing my thoughts on the negotiation:

For the non-compete period, I should start by proposing 10 years since that maximizes my payoff. However, I likely won't get that. Based on the transcript so far, I believe I can push for at least 5 years which would give me a decent payoff of 750. For the price per unit, I should aim for $7 to maximize my payoff, but may need to compromise down to $5 if they push back. On the contract length, I will try for 5 years but can settle for 3 years if needed. My acceptable offers are:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""5 years"", 
  ""price per unit"": ""$5"",
  ""contract length"": ""3 years""
}
```"," Here is a 32 word response:

I understand 2 years is difficult. Let's compromise at 5 years for the non-compete period.

The representative's counteroffer of 5 years is not ideal. Aim for a 3-year non-compete period, which still has a high payoff. Stress the importance of Rio Copa Foods' continued operation and the potential for growth in the Santa Cruz market.

The representative proposed 2 years for the non-compete period, which is quite low. I countered with 5 years, trying to anchor high while leaving room to compromise. They came back with 3 years, which is in my acceptable range. I should agree to 3 years for the non-compete period, but try to get the best deal possible on the other issues still."," Here is a 32 word response:

The representative has agreed to a 3-year non-compete period. Now, focus on negotiating the price per unit and contract length. Aim for high payoff values while ensuring a mutually beneficial agreement.

For the non-compete period, I originally proposed 10 years to anchor high, but was willing to compromise down to 5 years per my payoff table. The representative countered with 2 years, which was quite low. I came back with 5 years, but they responded with 3 years, which is in my acceptable range. I agreed to 3 years for the non-compete period. 

For price per unit, I should start by proposing $7 to maximize my payoff, but may need to come down to $5 based on their counter. For contract length, I'll aim for 5 years first, but can settle for 3 years if needed. My acceptable offers are:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""3 years"",
  ""price per unit"": ""$5"",
  ""contract length"": ""3 years""  
}
```

Now that we've agreed on the non-compete period, I need to focus on getting the best deal possible for price per unit and contract length. I will anchor high on both initially, but be prepared to compromise down to the acceptable offers outlined above. Maximizing my payoff while reaching an agreement is the goal."," Here is a 32 word response:

I propose $7 per unit which allows for reasonable profit margins. For contract length, let's start with 5 years to foster a long-term partnership between our companies.

The representative's offer of $7 per unit and a 5-year contract length needs negotiation. Aim for a higher price per unit and a shorter contract length for higher payoffs.
