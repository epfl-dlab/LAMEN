You,0,0,"Mental Note: Begin negotiations with a high non-compete period, but be prepared to reduce it. The goal is to secure the shortest non-compete period possible, as this directly impacts our payoff.

You,1,0," Here is a 150 word mental note organizing my thoughts on the negotiation:

I represent CPC's interests in acquiring Rio Copa Foods. My goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC based on the payoff tables. For the non-compete period, I should push for 10 years since that maximizes my payoff at 1500. However, I may need to compromise on a shorter period if needed to close the deal. On price, I should start lower at $100 million and try to compromise up to $150 million. For management positions, I can concede 2 spots to help secure the deal. On facility investments, I should hold firm at $20 million. Overall, I aim to maximize CPC's payoffs but am willing to make some concessions to successfully acquire this strategic asset. My acceptable offers are:

```json
{
  ""non-compete period"": ""5 years"", 
  ""price"": ""$130 million"",
  ""management positions"": ""2"",
  ""facility investments"": ""$20 million""
}

I understand your position. Perhaps we could find a compromise at 5 years for the non-compete period.

Based on the transcript, I will counter offer a 5 year non-compete period as a compromise between their offer of 3 years and my ideal of 10 years. This provides them some recovery time while still protecting CPC's interests."," Here is a 32 word response to continue the negotiations:
