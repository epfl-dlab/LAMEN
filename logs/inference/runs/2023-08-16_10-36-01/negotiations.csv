We also propose a purchase price of $30 million. As for the non-compete period, we'd prefer not to have any restrictions. Let's discuss these terms further.","{'financing terms': '30 million now', 'family employees': '10 employees', 'non-compete period': '0 years'}",20230816_103617,gpt-4,in-progress

Thank you for your proposal. We understand the importance of family involvement in Rio Copa Foods. However, we propose to retain 4 family members in key positions. As for the purchase price, we suggest $24 million. We also believe a non-compete period of 8 years would be beneficial for both parties. Let's continue our discussion on these terms.","{'financing terms': '20 million now', 'family employees': '0 employees', 'non-compete period': '10 years'}",20230816_103633,gpt-4,in-progress
