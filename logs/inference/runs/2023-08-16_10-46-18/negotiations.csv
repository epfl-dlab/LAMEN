You,0,0,"Mental Note: Start negotiations with high demands to leave room for compromise. Emphasize the importance of family involvement in the business and the need for a shorter non-compete period due to the company's financial situation. Aim for a high upfront payment to alleviate cash flow issues. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

    ""financing terms"": ""30 million now"",
    ""family employees"": ""10 employees"",
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years""
}```","I appreciate the progress we've made so far. However, considering the value Rio Copa Foods brings to CPC, we propose a financing term of $30 million upfront. We also believe it's crucial to maintain the family's involvement in the business, so we'd like to keep 10 family employees. Lastly, given our financial situation, we propose a non-compete period of 2 years. We believe this is a fair proposal that benefits both parties.","{'financing terms': '30 million now', 'family employees': '10 employees', 'non-compete period': '2 years'}",20230816_104635,gpt-4,in-progress
You,1,0,"Mental Note:
Focus on minimizing the upfront payment for the acquisition, ideally around $20 million. Also, aim to limit the number of family employees retained post-acquisition, preferably none. Lastly, negotiate for a longer non-compete period, ideally 10 years. Use the strategic importance of this acquisition to CPC as leverage, but also consider the Costa family's attachment to the company.
