You,0,0,"Mental Note: Begin negotiations with a high non-compete period, aiming for 10 years. This is the most beneficial for CPC. However, be prepared to negotiate down if necessary.

The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. My goal is to minimize this period as much as possible to maximize my payoff.
