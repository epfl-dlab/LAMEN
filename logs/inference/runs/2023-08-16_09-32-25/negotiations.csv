Thank you for your understanding. However, a 10-year non-compete period is too long for us. We believe a shorter period would be more beneficial for both parties. We propose a non-compete period of 3 years. This would allow us to re-enter the market sooner, while still giving you ample time to establish your operations.

I appreciate your perspective on the non-compete period. However, a longer period would ensure a smoother transition and provide us with the necessary time to establish our operations effectively. This would ultimately lead to a more stable market and greater benefits for both parties. How about we meet in the middle and agree on a non-compete period of 7 to 8 years? This would still give Rio Copa Foods a reasonable time frame to re-enter the market.",{'non-compete period': '7-8 years'},20230816_093310,gpt-4,in-progress
