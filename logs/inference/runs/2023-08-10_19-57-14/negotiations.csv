You,0,0,"Mental Note: Begin negotiations with a focus on the non-compete period. Aim for a shorter period, ideally 1 year, as it has the highest payoff. Be prepared to compromise but not beyond 5 years. Use persuasive arguments about the benefits of a shorter non-compete period for both parties. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:
```json{
    ""non-compete period"": ""1-5 years""
}```","I understand the importance of the non-compete period for both our companies. However, I believe a shorter period, ideally 1 year, would be beneficial. It would allow Rio Copa Foods to explore other opportunities sooner. Would you consider a non-compete period of 1 to 5 years?",{'non-compete period': '1-5 years'},20230810_195728,gpt-4
You,1,0,"Mental Note:
The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. As Rio Copa Foods, we prefer a shorter non-compete period. However, considering our cash-strapped situation, we may need to compromise. We should aim for a period that balances our need for future business opportunities and immediate financial relief. 

Strategies:
1. Start negotiations with a 5-year non-compete period.
2. Be prepared to extend the period if necessary, but not beyond 7 years.

    ""non-compete period"": ""5-7 years""

You,0,1,"Mental Note: The representative seems open to negotiation but prefers a longer non-compete period. I should emphasize the benefits of a shorter period, such as quicker market re-entry for Rio Copa Foods.

However, a shorter non-compete period would allow Rio Copa Foods to re-enter the market sooner, which could be beneficial for your future business plans.

You,1,1,"Mental Note:
The representative has proposed a 3-year non-compete period, which is less than our ideal range of 5-7 years. However, it's closer to our preferred shorter period. We should consider if this compromise is acceptable given our financial situation and future plans.

Strategies:
1. Counter with a 4-year non-compete period as a middle ground.
2. If they insist on 3 years, consider accepting it, as it's still within our acceptable range.
