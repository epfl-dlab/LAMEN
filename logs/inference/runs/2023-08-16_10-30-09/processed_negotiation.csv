Start negotiations with high demands to leave room for compromise. For financing terms, aim for $30 million. For family employees, insist on retaining as many as possible, ideally 10. For the non-compete period, push for a shorter duration, ideally 0 years. Be prepared to make concessions but prioritize family employees and non-compete period over financing terms.

Focus on minimizing the upfront payment for the acquisition, ideally around $20 million. Limit the number of family employees retained to a minimum, preferably none.
