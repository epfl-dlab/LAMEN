You,0,0,"Mental Note: 

Start negotiations by emphasizing the value Rio Copa Foods brings to CPC. Highlight the strategic fit and the access to the Santa Cruz market. Use this as leverage to negotiate a shorter non-compete period. Remember, the shorter the non-compete period, the higher the payoff. Aim for a non-compete period of 2 years or less, but be prepared to compromise up to 4 years if necessary. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""2 years""
}
```","We understand the value Rio Copa Foods brings to CPC. Considering this, we propose a non-compete period of 2 years. This allows us to continue our family business sooner.",{'non-compete period': '2 years'},20230816_101224,gpt-4,in-progress
You,1,0,"Mental Note:
The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. The longer the period, the higher the payoff for CPC. The strategy should be to push for a longer non-compete period, ideally 10 years. However, considering the interests of Rio Copa Foods, a compromise might be necessary. 

Acceptable Offer:
```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""8 years""
}```","We appreciate your proposal. However, considering the strategic importance of this acquisition for CPC, we propose a non-compete period of 8 years. This ensures a smooth transition for both parties.",{'non-compete period': '8 years'},20230816_101239,gpt-4,in-progress
You,0,1,"Mental Note: 

The representative's offer of 8 years is far from our ideal. However, we must remember our cash-strapped situation. We should counteroffer with a 4-year non-compete period, emphasizing the value we bring to CPC and our need to continue our family business. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""4 years""

You,1,1,"Mental Note:
The representative of Rio Copa Foods has proposed a 4-year non-compete period, which is significantly lower than our ideal payoff. We need to emphasize the strategic importance of a longer non-compete period for CPC and propose a counteroffer closer to our acceptable range. 

Acceptable Offer:

The representative's counteroffer of 7 years is still too long. We need to emphasize our value to CPC and our need to continue our family business. Counteroffer with a 3-year non-compete period, but be prepared to compromise up to 5 years if necessary. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""3 years""
