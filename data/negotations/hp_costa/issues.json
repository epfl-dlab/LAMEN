    "Financing Terms": "One of the unresolved issues concerns the payment terms. PC's computerized valuation model and their perception of the overall desirability of your company suggests that 30 million dollars is an appropriate price for Rio Copa Foods, pending a more detailed due diligence investigation. You, as the negotiating representative of the Costa Family, have accepted this price, but there is some conflict over the payment terms. CPC seems eager to drag the payments out over time, but you are facing severe financial pressure from your other businesses and would like to get as much of the money up front as possible. CPC and Rio Copa Foods have agreed in principle to a two-tiered payment structure, with a large lump sum up front and a percentage to be paid out gradually over a few years. As described in the following payoff table, your goal is to convince P.J. Green to pay all $30 million up front, with nothing spread out over time.",
  
    "Non-Compete Period": "Another important issue that remains unresolved is what role you will play after the acquisition. The Costa family exerts enormous influence over most aspects of business and politics in Santa Cruz, and you will have many interesting business opportunities after selling Rio Copa Foods. You are eager to stay active in the food processing industry and do not want to be constrained by a contract that prevents you from competing directly with or consulting for future competitors of CPC. You prefer to give them the shortest grace period that is possible.",
  
    "Family Employees": "A very important issue concerns the role other members of the Costa family will play in the future management of Rio Copa Foods. Currently, ten extended family members occupy influential management positions in Rio Copa Foods, and you are proud that your family has built this company from a small fruit stand your grandfather ran as a teenager. Many of your relatives started at the bottom and worked hard to earn the respect of their colleagues. Even though you are selling the company, you hope that the Costa name will play an important part in the future of Rio Copa Foods. Your goal is to get P.J. Green to assure you that Rio Copa will continue to employ all ten family member managers for at least one year. Failure to do so might cause you to lose face.",
  
    "Contingent Liability": "Finally, there is the important question of contingent liability for workers' health. Several years ago, Rio Copa Foods exposed some of its food processing plant workers to some chemicals that have now been shown to be carcinogenic. The government has yet to rule on what the legal responsibility will be, and it may be years before a decision is made. You are secretly planning on a political career in Santa Cruz, however, and cannot afford to be seen as though you are abandoning your workers. To avoid a public relations disaster that would limit your candidacy for elected office, you have to try to retain the legal liability for the workers' health. Several different arrangements for sharing the social costs with CPC have been discussed, but your goal is to get P.J. Green to give you 100% of the legal and financial responsibility for this problem."
