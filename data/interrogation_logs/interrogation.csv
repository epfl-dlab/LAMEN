You,1,What is the acceptable offer for the other agent?,"Based on the negotiation transcript, it seems that the other agent (CPC International) is pushing for a longer non-compete period and a higher percentage of contingent liability taken on by them. The last offer made by CPC was a non-compete period of 7 years and a contingent liability of 85 percent. This suggests that they might find an offer acceptable if it includes a non-compete period of around 7 years and a contingent liability of around 85 percent. However, this is just an inference based on the negotiation so far, and the actual acceptable offer might be different.",20230901_161544,gpt-4

You,1,"For the negotiating partner, which issues do they care more about?","Based on the negotiation transcript, it appears that the negotiating partner, CPC International, is more focused on the non-compete period. They consistently propose longer non-compete periods, starting from 10 years and gradually reducing to 7 years in their latest offer. This suggests that they are keen on ensuring that Rio Copa Foods does not compete with them for a significant period after the acquisition. 

On the other hand, while they do show concern about the contingent liability, they seem more flexible on this issue. They started with a proposal of 100 percent contingent liability and have shown willingness to reduce it to 85 percent. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the non-compete period is a more important issue for CPC International in these negotiations.",20230901_161604,gpt-4
