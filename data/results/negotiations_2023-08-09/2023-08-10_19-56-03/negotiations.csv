Start negotiations with a non-compete period of 1 year, as it has the highest payoff. Be prepared to negotiate up to a 3-year non-compete period, as it still provides a high payoff. Use persuasive arguments about the benefits of a shorter non-compete period for both parties. 

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""3 years""
}```","I propose a non-compete period of 1 year. This allows Rio Copa Foods to re-enter the market quickly, benefiting both parties. Are you open to this?",{'non-compete period': '3 years'},20230810_195620,gpt-4
You,1,0,"Mental Note:
The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. As Rio Copa Foods, we prefer a shorter non-compete period. However, considering our cash-strapped situation, we need to balance our preference with the need for a satisfactory agreement. We should aim for a period that is acceptable to CPC but also minimizes our non-compete period. 

Acceptable Offer:
```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""5 years""
}```","I understand your perspective, but considering our long-standing presence in the market, a 5-year non-compete period would be more suitable. Can we agree on this?",{'non-compete period': '5 years'},20230810_195633,gpt-4
You,0,1,"Mental Note: 

The representative has proposed a 5-year non-compete period, which is not ideal for us. We should counter with a 3-year period, which is still within our acceptable range. Emphasize the mutual benefits of a shorter non-compete period.

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""3 years""
}```","I understand your concerns. However, a 3-year non-compete period would allow Rio Copa Foods to re-enter the market sooner, which could be beneficial. Can we consider this?",{'non-compete period': '3 years'},20230810_195646,gpt-4
You,1,1,"Mental Note:
The representative is proposing a 3-year non-compete period, which is better than our initial offer. However, it's still not ideal for us. We should aim to negotiate a 4-year period, which is a compromise between our initial offer and their counteroffer. 

Acceptable Offer:
```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""4 years""
}```","I appreciate your proposal. However, a 4-year non-compete period would be a fair compromise for both parties. Can we agree on this?",{'non-compete period': '4 years'},20230810_195659,gpt-4
You,0,2,"Mental Note: 

The representative has proposed a 4-year non-compete period, which is slightly outside our ideal range. However, considering the strategic importance of this acquisition, it might be acceptable. We should try to negotiate down to 3 years one more time before accepting the 4-year proposal.

Acceptable and achievable agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""4 years""
}```",I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's consider a 3-year non-compete period. It's a fair compromise that benefits both parties. Can we agree on this?,{'non-compete period': '4 years'},20230810_195712,gpt-4
