Start negotiations with a high non-compete period, aiming for 10 years. This will maximize my payoff. However, be prepared to negotiate down to a lower period if necessary. Remember, the goal is to reach a satisfactory agreement with CPC, but also to secure the best possible deal for Rio Copa Foods and the Costa family.

Acceptable and Achievable Agreement:

```json
{
    ""non-compete period"": ""8 years""
}
```",I propose a non-compete period of 10 years. This will ensure a smooth transition and protect both our interests. Let's discuss this further.,{'non-compete period': '8 years'},20230810_201332,gpt-4
You,1,0," Here is a 150 word mental note summarizing my thoughts on the negotiation so far:

I represent CPC's interests in acquiring Rio Copa Foods. My goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC based on the payoff tables provided. The non-compete period is the main issue. I should push for a longer period as it is very valuable to CPC with a payoff of 1.0 for 10 years. However, Rio Copa will want a shorter period so I need to compromise. My acceptable offer is 6 years at a payoff of 0.444. On other issues like royalty rate and board seats, I should also aim for outcomes closer to CPC's interests. Overall I need to balance getting the best deal with reaching an agreement Rio Copa will accept. My strategy is to anchor high, make small concessions, and frame offers to highlight mutual benefits.

I understand your desire for 10 years. However, I believe 6 years is more reasonable. This still protects both our interests during the transition, while allowing you flexibility afterwards. Shall we agree on 6 years?",{'non-compete period': '6 years'},20230810_201348,claude-2

The representative has proposed a 6-year non-compete period, which is lower than my acceptable agreement of 8 years. I need to negotiate and convince them to agree to a longer period. I should emphasize the benefits of a longer non-compete period for both parties.

The representative is insistent on a 6-year non-compete period. I need to be firm on my acceptable agreement of 8 years. I should highlight the long-term benefits of an 8-year period and the potential risks of a shorter period.

As the representative for CPC's interests in acquiring Rio Copa Foods, my goal is to negotiate the best deal for CPC based on the provided payoff tables. The main issue is the non-compete period - I should push for a longer period since it's very valuable to CPC, with 10 years having a maximal payoff of 1.0. However, Rio Copa will prefer a shorter period, so I need to compromise. My acceptable offer is 6 years at a payoff of 0.444. For other issues like royalty rate and board seats, I'll also aim for outcomes closer to CPC's interests. Overall I must balance optimizing CPC's payoff with reaching an agreement Rio Copa will accept. My strategy is to anchor high with 10 years, make gradual concessions down to 6-8 years, and frame offers to highlight mutual benefits. Understanding Rio Copa's motivations and constraints is key to finding common ground. Patience and persistence will be necessary to get the best deal.
