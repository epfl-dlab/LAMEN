You,0,0,"Mental Note: Start negotiations with a high non-compete period, aiming for 10 years. This will maximize my payoff.

The primary issue to negotiate is the non-compete period. My goal is to minimize this period to maximize my payoff. I should emphasize the benefits for Rio Copa Foods in having a shorter non-compete period, such as the potential for future collaborations.

Thank you for your proposal. We understand your concerns, but we believe a 10-year non-compete period might limit potential future collaborations between our companies.
