descriptions:
  - One of the most important unresolved issues concerns the payment terms. CPC's computerized valuation model and their perception of the overall desirability of this acquisition suggests that 30 million U.S. dollars is an appropriate price for Rio Copa Foods, pending a more detailed due diligence investigation. The Rio Copa's President's Family has accepted this price, but there is some conflict over the payment terms. Rio Copa's representative seems eager to receive the entire sum of money quickly, but CPC's head accountant has explained that there are important tax and legal advantages to a staggered payment schedule. CPC and Rio Copa Foods have agreed in principle to a two tiered payment structure, with a large lump sum up front and a percentage to be paid out gradually over a few years. As described in the following payoff table, your goal is to convince Rio Copa's representative to accept $20 million up front, with $10 million spread out over the next two years.
