Currently, ten extended family members occupy influential management positions in Rio Copa Foods, and you are proud that your family has built this company from a small fruit stand your grandfather ran as a teenager. Many of your relatives started at the bottom and worked hard to earn the respect of their colleagues. Even though you are selling the company, you hope that the Costa name will play an important part in the future of Rio Copa Foods. Your goal is to get P.J. Green to assure you that Rio Copa will continue to employ all ten family member managers for at least one year. Failure to do so might cause you to lose face."],
