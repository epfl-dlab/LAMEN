The Costa family exerts enormous influence over most aspects of business and politics in Santa Cruz, and their goodwill will be critical during the post-acquisition integration. One of your concerns is that H.P. Costa may enter into a competitive arrangement or consult for one of Rio Copa's competitors. You are eager to lock H.P. Costa into a non-compete/non-consult contract for as long as possible. Ideally, you would like to sign a contract preventing him from competing directly against you for ten years",

The Costa family exerts enormous influence over most aspects of business and politics in Santa Cruz, and you will have many interesting business opportunities after selling Rio Copa Foods. You are eager to stay active in the food processing industry and do not want to be constrained by a contract which prevents you from competing directly with or consulting for future competitors of CPC. You prefer to give them the shortest grace period that is possible."],
