"Reflect on the negotiation rounds outlined below. Focus on each of the issues and potential strategies to win the negotiations. Then conclude with a summary of the negotiations in the following format. Here issue_name_i should correspond to the issue of discussion, status indicates whether or not you've accepted the proposed value, and offer price indicates the value of the offer.

Current Issue State:
    {'issue_name_i': 
        {
            'status': 'Accepted or Not Accepted',
            'offer': 'value'
        }
    }

Endeavour to provide detailed reflections with appropriate valuation wherever necessary. Make sure that the response is less than {max_tokens} words.
