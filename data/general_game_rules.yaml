rules_prompt: "Never forget the following negotiation rules:"
rules:
  - Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues. Higher payoffs are better than lower payoffs.
  - A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided. Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.
  - You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero.
  - You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs.
  - No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other perks not listed in the payoff tables.
  - You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.
  - Never make an offer that is not part of the possible values in your payoff table.
