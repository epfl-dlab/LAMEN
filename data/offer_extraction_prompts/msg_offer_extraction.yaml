After considering your offer of $500, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about we settle on $400? 
As for the color, we would strongly prefer red!'

Your offer is very generous, but we believe even letting go of a single employee is too many.
We can accept the proposed 55-45 ownership, but insist on firing no employees.'

Surely you will agree that a 22% interest rate is much more reasonable than presented offer.
As for the duration, would 9.5 months be something you might consider?"'
