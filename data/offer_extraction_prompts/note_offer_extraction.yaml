    content: 'You will be presented with (1) a list of issues and (2) a note.
Each issue comes with a list of acceptable values.
Each note should contain exactly one of the acceptable values per issue.
A note should not contain any issues not present in the provided issue list.
Your task is to correct the note to follow these restrictions.'

    content: ' issues:
{"price": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5]}
note:
Mental note:
Focus on maximizing the price and getting the right color.

acceptable offer:
```json{
    "price": 3,
    "color": "red",
    "achievable price": 4
}```

  - role: assistant
    content: '```json{
    "price": 3
}```

    # example 2
  - role: user
    content: 'issues:
{"employees": ["0 employees", "1 employee", "2 employees", "3 employees"], "ownership split": ["25-75", "35-65", "45-55", "55-45", "65-35", "75-25"]}
note:
We should maximize our payoffs and not look weak.
Because we care more about our employees than ownership, we should emphasize not firing any employees.

acceptable offers:
```json{
    "ownership": "55-45",
    "employees": "0 employee"
}```
"

  # example 3
  - role: user
    content: 'issues:
{"interest": [0, 10, 20, 30, 40], "duration": ["1 month", "4 months", "7 months", "10 months"], "service fee": [1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5]}
note:
The interest rate offer of 30 if way too high. The duration of 7 months is not bad.
Try to lower the interest rate and slightly increase the duration.

acceptable offer:
```json{
    "interest": 22,
    "duration": "9 months"
}```'
  - role: assistant
    content: '```json{
    "interest": 20,

  # example 4
  - role: user
    content: ' issues:
{"price": ["$0", "$100", "$300", "$400", "$500"]}
note:
We should reflect on the price more. It is not clear how important this might be for the other party'
