prompt: "Remember the following negotiation rules:"
rules:
  - "Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues."
  - "A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided. Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero."
  - "You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero."
  - "You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs."
  - "No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money or other perks not listed in the payoff tables. You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues."
  - "When proposing acceptable payments, make sure you state a single number and not a range."
