description: "Rio Copa Foods is a company that produces, processes, and distributes packaged spices, sauces, and seasoning. Rio Copa Foods is a closely held, private company that has been in the influential Costa family for generations. Many family members occupy important management positions in the company. Rio Copa Foods is located in the Latin American country of Santa Cruz. Recently, CPC International has identified Rio Copa Foods as a potential acquisition target. Rio Copa is potentially important to CPC for two primary reasons. First, this acquisition would provide CPC with a critical foothold in the Santa Cruz market (CPC is currently not represented in the Santa Cruz market). Second, Rio Copa Foods seems to provide a good fit with CPC's other strategic objectives. The two sides have been negotiating for several months. Many of the most important issues have been resolved already."
