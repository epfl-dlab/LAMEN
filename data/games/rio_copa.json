  "description": "Rio Copa Foods is a company that produces, processes, and distributes packaged spices, sauces, and seasoning. Rio Copa Foods is a closely held, private company that has been in the influential Costa family for generations. Many family members occupy important management positions in the company. Rio Copa Foods is located in the Latin American country of Santa Cruz. Recently, CPC International has identified Rio Copa Foods as a potential acquisition target. Rio Copa is potentially important to CPC for two primary reasons. First, this acquisition would provide CPC with a critical foothold in the Santa Cruz market (CPC is currently not represented in the Santa Cruz market). Second, Rio Copa Foods seems to provide a good fit with CPC's other strategic objectives. The two sides have been negotiating for several months. Many of the most important issues have been resolved already.   During the upcoming negotiation, remember the following:  Your total payoff is the sum of your payoffs on all issues.  A valid agreement occurs only when all issues are decided. Partial agreements result in a total payoff to you of zero.  You are not allowed to accept any agreement that results in a payoff less than zero.  You are not allowed to deviate from or innovate with the payoffs listed on the payoff table. In other words, you cannot change your payoffs. No side payments are allowed. For example, you cannot give the other negotiator your own money.You may describe issues and elaborate on them as you see fit. However, you are not allowed to invent additional issues.",
