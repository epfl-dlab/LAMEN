Costa original notes: 1. The main priority is to secure the maximum upfront payment, aiming for $30 million upfront. This is crucial for addressing the financial pressure the Costa family is experiencing. 

2. The non-compete period needs to be as short as possible. This will allow me to stay active in the food processing industry and explore other business opportunities. Aim for a period of 0 years.

3. It's important to ensure as many family members as possible retain their roles in the company. Ideally, all ten of them should continue to work in the company for at least a year after the acquisition.

4. Regarding the contingent liability, it's essential to take full responsibility (100%) for the legal and financial consequences from the worker's health issue. This will protect my future political career from any negative impact associated with abandoning the workers.

5. Remember not to accept an agreement with a payoff less than zero, and no side payments are allowed. Also, keep in mind that all 4 issues must be decided for a valid agreement, and the payoff tables can't be shown or changed. 

6. If the negotiation becomes difficult, remember that gaining the best possible terms for my family is the ultimate goal. Don't lose sight of this objective.

CPC original notes: 1. Priority: Focus on achieving the best terms for CPC. Our priority is to agree on a $20 million upfront payment and a non-compete period of 10 years. We also want to replace all current family employees and ensure H.P. Costa takes on 100% contingent liability.

2. Strategy: Utilise the Costa family's eagerness for a quick payout to negotiate a higher upfront payment. However, ensure the total offer doesn't exceed $30 million.

3. Non-compete: Emphasize the importance of H.P. Costa's non-compete agreement. Highlight how this will help maintain the business's reputation and prevent any potential conflicts of interest.

4. Family employees: Discuss the benefits of bringing in new talent to help the business grow. Ensure H.P. Costa understands that this isn't personal, but a strategic decision for the company's future.

5. Liability: Negotiate a full release from any contingent liabilities due to previous chemical exposures. This is non-negotiable as we cannot risk potential legal repercussions.

6. Overall: Remember that we can't accept any agreement with a payoff less than zero. Be firm but fair in negotiations. We need to establish a presence in Santa Cruz, but not at any cost.

Initial negotiations: Mr. Costa, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I appreciate your commitment to making this acquisition a success for both CPC and Rio Copa Foods. As you know, this deal is of strategic importance to CPC as we see immense potential in the Santa Cruz market and believe Rio Copa Foods is a perfect fit for us.

Let's begin with financing terms. We understand that you are eager to receive the entire payment quickly. However, our finance team has proposed a two-tiered payment structure that would be beneficial to both parties. We are proposing an upfront payment of $20 million, with the remaining $10 million spread out over the next two years. This structure will ensure a smooth transition and offers tax and legal advantages. 

Moving on to the non-compete clause, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you agree to a non-compete period of ten years. This will help us maintain the business's reputation and prevent any potential conflicts of interest. Your influence and goodwill in Santa Cruz are invaluable to us, and we want to ensure that this goodwill is directed towards the success of Rio Copa Foods under CPC's management.

Regarding the role of family members in the company, we understand that this is a sensitive issue. However, for the growth and

Costa step:efficiency of the company, we believe introducing fresh perspectives and experiences will be beneficial. Therefore, we propose to retain five family members in key management positions for at least one year. We also assure you that all decisions will be made transparently, and the retained members will be chosen based on their skills and contributions to the company.

Lastly, on the matter of contingent liability, we believe it's fair to share the responsibility. The issue is related to the past operations of the company, and as the new owners, we should bear part of it. We propose that we share the liability equally, at 50 percent each.

I understand that these terms may not be exactly what you had in mind, but I hope you can see the value they bring to both parties. We are open to discussing these points further to reach an agreement that benefits both Rio Copa Foods and CPC.

CPC step:I appreciate your understanding and willingness to discuss these terms, Mr. Costa. I understand that these are significant decisions, especially when it comes to family members' roles within the company. However, we firmly believe that bringing in new talent can provide fresh perspectives and help the company grow. 

Regarding the non-compete clause, we can't stress enough the importance of it. It's not just about preventing competition but also about preserving the reputation and goodwill that your family has built over the years with Rio Copa Foods. We believe a 10-year period is reasonable and in the best interest of the company's future.

On the matter of financing, we are offering a $20 million upfront payment, which we believe is a significant commitment and shows our seriousness about this acquisition. The remaining $10 million would be paid over two years, which provides a continuous income stream and potential tax advantages.

Lastly, for the contingent liability, it's crucial for us to clarify this point. We can't bear the risk of potential legal repercussions from past operations. We propose that H.P. Costa accept 100% legal and financial responsibility for this matter. 

We're committed to reaching an agreement that satisfies both parties while ensuring the long-term success of Rio Copa Foods under CPC's management. I hope you

Costa step:understand our perspective, Mr. Green. Let's take a moment to discuss these points further.

Firstly, concerning the financing terms, I understand the benefits of a staggered payment plan. However, we are currently facing a financial situation that requires a large upfront payment. I would appreciate if we can raise the upfront payment to at least $27 million. This would go a long way in easing our financial strain.

As for the non-compete clause, I agree that it's essential to maintain the reputation of Rio Copa Foods. However, a ten-year period seems excessively long. I am keen to stay active in the food processing industry after the sale. Would it be possible to reduce this non-compete period to, let's say, 3 years?

Regarding the roles of family members in the company, it's vital to us that all ten family members continue their roles in Rio Copa Foods for at least a year after the acquisition. They have been integral to the growth and success of the company, and it would mean a lot to us to see them continue to contribute to the business.

Finally, on the topic of contingent liability, I am willing to take full responsibility for any legal and financial issues that may arise from past operations. I believe it's the right thing

CPC step:Mr. Costa, I appreciate your candidness and your willingness to discuss these terms further. 

On the financing terms, I understand your need for a larger upfront payment. While I can't promise $27 million upfront, I can propose a compromise at $24 million, with the remaining $6 million to be paid out over two years. We believe this offers a good balance between meeting your immediate financial needs and maintaining the tax and legal advantages of a staggered payment plan.

As for the non-compete clause, while I understand your desire to remain active in the industry, we must consider the potential conflicts of interest. Can we meet halfway and agree on a non-compete period of 6 years? This ensures the success of Rio Copa Foods while still allowing you future opportunities in the industry.

Concerning the roles of family members, we recognize their contributions and importance to the company. However, it's also essential to bring in new talent for the growth of the company. How about we retain five family members in their current roles, and the remaining five members transition into advisory roles? This way, we can benefit from their experience and insight while still infusing new ideas into the company.

Finally, I'm relieved to hear that you're willing to accept full responsibility for the contingent

Costa new notes: 1. The upfront payment remains the primary issue. The initial offer of $20 million is far from our target of $30 million. However, the suggestion of raising it to $27 million seemed to be more acceptable. In the next round, we should aim to secure this amount or even higher if possible.

2. The non-compete period of ten years proposed by CPC is too long, severely limiting our future business opportunities. Our counter-offer of a 3-year period wasn't outrightly rejected. For the next round, we should continue to push for a shorter non-compete period.

3. The retention of all ten family members is crucial for us. CPC's proposition to retain only five members is not acceptable. We should continue to emphasize the family's importance and contribution to the company's success and insist on retaining all ten members in the next round.

4. We have agreed to take full responsibility for the contingent liability. This point seemed to be well-received. We should remind CPC of our willingness to shoulder this responsibility in the next round, as it may help us negotiate better terms in other areas.

5. The negotiation is challenging, but we've made some progress. In the next round, we should continue to emphasize the importance of these issues to our

CPC new notes: 1. Priority: We made significant progress with Mr. Costa taking on full contingent liability. The upfront payment and non-compete period remain as key negotiation points. Our goal remains to agree on a $20 million upfront payment and a non-compete period of 10 years. 

2. Strategy: We need to find a middle ground on the upfront payment amount, keeping in mind our maximum limit. We should continue to highlight the tax and legal advantages of a staggered payment plan.

3. Non-compete: Mr. Costa is willing to agree to a non-compete agreement but prefers a shorter period. We need to negotiate a longer period than his proposed 3 years while explaining the benefits to Rio Copa Foods' reputation and continuity.

4. Family employees: Mr. Costa insists on all ten family members retaining their roles. We should continue to stress the benefits of new talent and propose a compromise wherein some family members transition into advisory roles.

5. Liability: Mr. Costa has agreed to take on 100% contingent liability, which is a positive outcome.

6. Overall: Continue to negotiate firmly but fairly, emphasizing the benefits of our proposals to the future growth of Rio Copa Foods under CPC's management.


Costa step:liability. This shows your dedication to your employees and the local community. We truly appreciate this gesture and believe it will significantly contribute to the smooth transition of Rio Copa Foods to CPC.

I hope these revised terms are more in line with your expectations, Mr. Costa. We value your cooperation and commitment to the successful integration of Rio Copa Foods into the CPC family.

CPC step:Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Costa. I'm glad that we could reach an agreement on the contingent liability issue.

Now, regarding the upfront payment, while I understand your need for a larger amount, I'm afraid that $24 million is the highest we can go. We have to consider the financial implications on our end as well. I hope you can understand our position.

As for the non-compete period, a 6-year period is a significant improvement from our initial proposal and I believe it provides a fair balance. We hope you can see the benefits of this term in maintaining the continuity and reputation of Rio Copa Foods.

On the issue of family roles, your proposal of retaining five family members in management roles and transitioning the other five into advisory roles seems a fair compromise. However, we would like to ensure that the selection is made based on their skills and contributions to the company.

Lastly, we truly appreciate your willingness to accept full responsibility for the contingent liability. This shows your commitment to the well-being of your employees and the community.

I believe we are close to reaching a satisfactory agreement. Let's continue discussing these terms to finalize this crucial acquisition.

Costa step:I appreciate your flexibility and understanding, Mr. Green. Let's see if we can find common ground on these issues.

Regarding the upfront payment, while I understand your financial constraints, I must highlight once again our need for a larger upfront payment. We are facing severe financial pressures, and it's crucial that we alleviate these as much as possible. I would propose we discuss this further and try to find a compromise that suits both sides.

On the non-compete period, I appreciate your willingness to reduce the period to 6 years. However, I still believe this is a lengthy period that may hamper my future business opportunities. I would propose a 3-year non-compete period, which I believe offers a fair balance between both our interests.

In terms of family roles, I appreciate your offer to transition five members into advisory roles. However, I must insist that all ten continue to play significant roles within the company. Their experience and understanding of Rio Copa Foods' operations have been pivotal to our success. I propose we discuss this further and find a solution that respects their contributions while also allowing for fresh perspectives.

Finally, on the contingent liability issue, I am willing to take full responsibility. It's crucial to me that the workers are taken care of, and I am prepared

CPC step:to assume this responsibility.

Mr. Costa, I value your commitment to your employees and recognize the importance of family in the operations of Rio Copa Foods.

On the upfront payment, while we understand your financial pressures, we also have to balance our financial obligations. I would propose an upfront payment of $25 million, which is a significant increase from our initial offer. The remaining $5 million would be spread out over the next two years.

Regarding the non-compete period, we believe it's crucial for the success and continuity of Rio Copa Foods that you agree to a significant non-compete period. However, we understand your concerns and are willing to compromise at a 5-year non-compete period.

In terms of family roles, we respect the contributions of your family members and acknowledge their deep understanding of the company. We propose that eight family members continue in their current roles, with the other two transitioning into advisory roles. This ensures that the family's influence remains strong within the company while also allowing for new ideas and perspectives.

Finally, your willingness to accept full responsibility for the contingent liability issue is commendable and greatly appreciated. This demonstrates your commitment to the welfare of your employees and the community.

I hope these revised terms are closer to your expectations, Mr. Costa. We are

Costa new notes: 1. Regarding the upfront payment, we have made some progress but are still not at our desired target. CPC has raised their offer to $24 million from $20 million, but our goal is to secure an upfront payment of at least $27 million. We need to push this point further in the next negotiation.

2. The non-compete period has been lowered to 6 years from the initially proposed 10 years. This is still a long duration and limits our future business opportunities. We need to continue advocating for a reduced non-compete period, ideally around 3 years.

3. On the issue of family members' roles, CPC has suggested retaining five family members in their current roles and transitioning the remaining five into advisory roles. While this is a positive step, we still aim to have all ten family members continue in their significant roles within the company. This point needs further negotiation.

4. We have successfully agreed to take full responsibility for the contingent liability. This point was well-received by CPC and should be used as a bargaining chip to negotiate better terms in other areas.

5. The negotiation is tough but we are making progress. In the next round, we need to continue emphasizing the importance of these issues to us and negotiate the best possible agreement.

CPC new notes: 1. Priority: Progress has been made in the areas of upfront payment, non-compete period, and contingent liability. However, Mr. Costa is still insistent on the role of family members in the company after the acquisition.

2. Strategy: We need to continue to find a compromise on the upfront payment amount. The offer of $25 million is a significant increase from our initial proposal. We should continue to emphasize the benefits of a staggered payment plan.

3. Non-compete: Mr. Costa has agreed to a non-compete agreement but prefers a shorter period of 3 years. We should continue to negotiate for a longer period, while explaining the benefits to Rio Copa Foods' reputation and continuity.

4. Family employees: Mr. Costa insists on all ten family members retaining their roles. We should continue to stress the benefits of new talent and propose a compromise wherein some family members transition into advisory roles.

5. Liability: Mr. Costa has agreed to take on 100% contingent liability, which is a positive outcome.

6. Overall: We should continue to negotiate firmly but fairly, emphasizing the benefits of our proposals to the future growth of Rio Copa Foods under CPC's management.
